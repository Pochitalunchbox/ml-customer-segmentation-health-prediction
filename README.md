# üß† ML Customer Segmentation & Health Prediction

This repository presents a multi-domain machine learning project that simulates real-world business applications through three core tasks: **customer segmentation**, **housing price prediction**, and **disease classification**. It demonstrates end-to-end data science workflows‚Äîfrom data cleaning to model interpretation‚Äîusing diverse datasets from retail, real estate, and healthcare sectors.

## üíº Problem Context

This project tackles three business-driven problems:

1. **Retail**: How can businesses segment customers for targeted marketing?
2. **Real Estate**: Can we predict house prices based on neighborhood and demographic features?
3. **Healthcare**: Is it possible to predict liver disease using patient diagnostic data?

By applying clustering, regression, and classification techniques, this project delivers actionable insights for decision-makers across industries.

## üìå Executive Summary

- **Clustering (Unsupervised Learning)**: Identified high-value customer groups using K-Means, GMM, and HAC.
- **Regression (Supervised Learning)**: Built and compared four models to predict California housing prices.
- **Classification (Supervised Learning)**: Developed multiple classifiers to predict liver disease presence.

Models were evaluated using **accuracy, ROC AUC, R¬≤, and F1 Score**, with business-oriented insights extracted from each task.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Languages & Libraries**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- **Machine Learning**: K-Means, GMM, HAC, Linear/Polynomial/Lasso/Random Forest Regressor, Logistic Regression, SVC, KNN, Random Forest Classifier
- **Metrics**: Accuracy, R¬≤, F1 Score, ROC AUC, Confusion Matrix

## üìä Visual Highlights & Business Insights

### 1. Customer Segmentation (K-Means)
![K-Means](results/kmeans_cluster_analysis.png.PNG)  
> Revealed 3 key segments‚Äîhigh-income, high-spending customers were ideal targets for loyalty campaigns.

### 2. GMM & HAC Clustering
![GMM](results/gmm_cluster_analysis.png.PNG)  ![HAC](results/hac_dendrogram_clusters.png.PNG)  
> GMM revealed overlapping segments suggesting the need for soft, adaptive marketing. HAC validated these clusters.

### 3. Random Forest Housing Regression
![RF Regressor](results/rf_regression_results.png.PNG)  
> Outperformed other models (R¬≤ = 0.92). Income and location were the strongest price predictors.

### 4. Lasso Regression Feature Shrinkage
![Lasso](results/lasso_regression.png.PNG)  
> Reduced overfitting and isolated high-impact features like median income.

### 5. Liver Disease Prediction (Random Forest)
![RF Classifier](results/rf_classification_results.png.PNG)  
> Achieved ROC AUC of 0.93. Medical markers like Alkaline Phosphatase were top predictors.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations & Future Work

- **Imbalanced classes** in the liver dataset affected model fairness. Future versions will apply SMOTE or cost-sensitive learning.
- The models are validated on held-out test sets but would benefit from **real-world A/B testing**.
- Adding a **Streamlit app** or **dashboard** for stakeholder-facing insights is in the roadmap.
